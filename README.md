# 🚗 Auto MPG Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of cars using the Auto MPG dataset.
We applied feature engineering, feature selection, scaling, data visualization, and linear regression modeling to build a predictive model.

The goal is to explore relationships between car features (e.g., displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, etc.) and fuel efficiency, and evaluate the accuracy of a regression model.



## 🛠 Features

✅ Data preprocessing

✅ Feature engineering

✅ Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

✅ Data visualization (correlation heatmap, boxplots, scatter plots.)

✅ Linear Regression model training & evaluation

✅ Model performance metrics:

R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 📂 Dataset

We use the Auto MPG Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Target variable: mpg (miles per gallon)

Features: cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model_year, origin, and engineered features.

## 🧮 Modeling

We trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
The results:

R² Score: ~0.87

MSE: ~6.992

RMSE: ~2.644


## 🚀 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)

Scikit-learn (preprocessing, scaling, regression model, evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook (interactive development)
